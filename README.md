# Coolors to Blender Color Ramp

Blender addon to convert a [coolors](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) url to a color ramp to allow for easy experimentation with colors.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Kalmarv/blender-coolors-addon/releases)
2. In Blender, go to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install
3. Then select the downloaded zip file and click Install Add-on
4. The addon should now be installed and you can enable it by checking the box next to it

## Usage

In the Shader Editor, press N to open the sidebar, then click the Coolors tab. Paste a coolors url into the text box and click the "Create Node" button. The color ramp should now be created and you can use it in your shader.

Updating the coolors url and clicking the "Create Node" button will update the color ramp with the new colors. This is the first version of the addon, so the UI and functionality may change in the future.

## Example

Turn this coolors url: `https://coolors.co/palette/f4f1de-e07a5f-3d405b-81b29a-f2cc8f`
